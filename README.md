Step 1: Create the Table for Terms and Definitions
Term	Definition in Assembly Language
Register	A small storage location within the CPU, e.g., AX, BX.
Opcode	Machine language instruction, e.g., MOV, ADD, SUB.
Label	Identifier for memory locations, e.g., loop_start:.
Immediate	Constant value in instructions, e.g., MOV AX, 5.
Addressing Mode	Way to specify operands (e.g., immediate, direct, indirect).
Step 2: Encapsulate the Table into a Capsule
A capsule in this context could be a modular data structure or a node containing the table and metadata.

Step 3: Repeat the Process for All Types, Variables, Values, and Tokens
Types Table
Type	Definition in Assembly Language
Byte	8-bit data type, e.g., DB (Define Byte).
Word	16-bit data type, e.g., DW (Define Word).
Double Word	32-bit data type, e.g., DD (Define Double Word).
Variables Table
Variable	Definition in Assembly Language
Counter	A variable to control loops, e.g., counter DB 0.
Pointer	Memory address variable, e.g., PTR.
Values Table
Value	Definition in Assembly Language
Literal	Hard-coded value, e.g., MOV AX, 10.
Symbolic	Referenced label or name, e.g., MOV AX, buffer.
Tokens Table
Token	Definition in Assembly Language
Mnemonic	Human-readable opcode, e.g., MOV.
Operand	Instruction argument, e.g., AX or 0x0040.
Step 4: Link Each Table to Its Capsule
Each capsule contains the above tables along with metadata about how they are interrelated. For example:

Capsule Terms contains the "Terms Table."
Capsule Types contains the "Types Table."
Capsule Variables contains the "Variables Table."
Capsule Values contains the "Values Table."
Capsule Tokens contains the "Tokens Table."
Step 5: Create a Node for Each Capsule
Each capsule becomes a node in the system. Nodes should include:

Unique Identifier: Each node is labeled, e.g., Node_Terms, Node_Types.
Properties: Metadata such as capsule type, last update timestamp, and permissions.
Step 6: Link Nodes to Create a Node Web
Nodes are connected via directed or undirected edges:

Terms node links to Types node.
Types node links to Variables node.
Variables node links to Tokens node, and so on.
This forms a Node Web, which can be represented as a graph structure.

Step 7: Implement Functional Operations
The system allows operations like:

Calling: Access specific nodes or capsules by ID or name.
Referencing: Link external systems or queries to nodes.
Routing: Pathfinding through the node web.
Borrowing/Loaning: Temporarily transfer a node's data for processing.
Swapping: Exchange the contents or links between two nodes.
Requesting: Query for data in a specific node.

1. Node Web Assignment to Registers
Each node web is assigned to a CPU register for efficient referencing and processing.
Registers represent low-level, high-speed storage ideal for handling modular data structures.

Node Web	Register Assignment
Node Web for Terms	AX
Node Web for Types	BX
Node Web for Variables	CX
Node Web for Values	DX
Node Web for Tokens	EX (Extended Register)
2. Group Registers into Clusters
Registers assigned to related node webs are clustered together.
For example:

Cluster 1: Handles all syntax-related elements (Terms, Tokens).
Cluster 2: Handles all data types and variables.
Cluster Name	Registers Included	Purpose
Syntax Cluster	AX, EX	Manage syntax structures like terms, tokens.
Data Cluster	BX, CX	Handle data definitions like types, variables.
3. Group Clusters into Banks
Clusters are grouped into banks for higher-order organization.
Banks are collections of clusters tied to specific high-level tasks or processing domains.

Bank Name	Clusters Included	Purpose
Syntax Bank	Syntax Cluster	Focused on parsing, tokenization, and language rules.
Data Bank	Data Cluster	Focused on defining and managing program data.
4. High-Level Flow
Node Webs: Collections of capsules representing interconnected knowledge.
Registers: Individual low-level processors assigned to node webs for access.
Clusters: Group registers for modular processing.
Banks: Aggregate clusters for domain-specific operations.
5. Functional Example
Node Web to Register Assignment
Assembly code for assigning node web to registers:

; Assign Node Webs to Registers
MOV AX, Node_Web_Terms       ; Load Terms Node Web into AX register
MOV BX, Node_Web_Types       ; Load Types Node Web into BX register
MOV CX, Node_Web_Variables   ; Load Variables Node Web into CX register
MOV DX, Node_Web_Values      ; Load Values Node Web into DX register
MOV EX, Node_Web_Tokens      ; Load Tokens Node Web into EX register
Cluster to Bank Grouping
Assembly code for grouping clusters into banks:

; Group Syntax Cluster into Syntax Bank
PUSH AX                     ; Push Syntax Register AX onto the stack
PUSH EX                     ; Push Syntax Register EX onto the stack

; Group Data Cluster into Data Bank
PUSH BX                     ; Push Data Register BX onto the stack
PUSH CX                     ; Push Data Register CX onto the stack
6. Visual Representation
Register-Cluster-Bank Hierarchy
Bank: Syntax Bank
  ├── Cluster: Syntax Cluster
  │    ├── Register: AX (Node Web: Terms)
  │    ├── Register: EX (Node Web: Tokens)
  │
Bank: Data Bank
  ├── Cluster: Data Cluster
       ├── Register: BX (Node Web: Types)
       ├── Register: CX (Node Web: Variables)
       ├── Register: DX (Node Web: Values)
7. Scalable Node Web Operations
Using this hierarchy, operations like calling, referencing, routing, or swapping can easily target a specific:

Node Web: Accessed via individual registers.
Cluster: Accessed as a collection of related registers.
Bank: Accessed as a domain-wide processor unit.
For instance:

Call Node_Web_Tokens: Access the EX register.
Route through Data Bank: Process BX, CX, DX.
